# appium-workshop
An Appium workshop on how to automate a native iOS/Android app with Appium.

> This workshop holds the exercises for the Appium workshop. The master branch will hold exercise 1. All other exercises can be found in branches called `exercise-#`, the `#` is the number of the exercise. 
If you want you can cheat, to be honest I don't mind, but you might need to ask yourself if that would be the best way to learn ;-)

## Requirements for the workshop
This workshop already provides you with a complete project setup for doing automation with JavaScript. I'll not be teaching you how to write tests in JavaScript, but only how to use Appium, how to find elements and so on.

The only thing I ask from you is to follow the steps below before we start the workshop. 

> Keep in mind that we donâ€™t have enough time during the workshop to dive into environmental issues. If your machine is not working we advise you to pair with someone who has his machine already configured and working.

I would also ask you to install a code editor that supports JavaScript, you can use a free trial version of for example WebStorm (download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=mac)), or use your favourite one. 

## Setting up Appium on your machine:
During this workshop weâ€™re going to focus on Android, because everybody can set this up on his machine (Windows / Linux / OSX). Please follow the instructions [here](./docs/APPIUM.md) for Android and make sure everything is working on your machine.

> If you have a Mac you might also want to install everything for iOS, but we will not be covering that during the workshop 

## Setting up Android and iOS on a local machine
For using Appium on your local machine you need an Android emulator or an iOS simulator on your machine. Check [this](./docs/ANDROID_IOS_SETUP.md) document for more information.

## Installing this project
Hopefully you've been able to set up your local machine for Android and or iOS. To use this project you need to download it to your local machine and install all the dependencies. This can be done with the following steps

- Clone the project to your local machine by opening a terminal and enter this
  
  `git clone https://github.com/wswebcreation/appium-workshop.git`
  
- Go to the folder of the project by entering this in your terminal
  
  `cd appium-workshop`
- Install all the dependencies by running this command in your terminal
  
  `npm install`

### Check if all works
I've created a simple test case to check if everything works on your machine. You can run this script by: 

- opening a terminal
- make sure you are in the `appium-workshop`-folder
- Open the just created Android emulator (**Make sure you created a Android emulator with the name `Pixel_8.1``, see [this](./docs/ANDROID_IOS_SETUP.md)-document**)
- Run the following command
  
  `npm run test.android`
  
  When everything was correct, you would see the following logs
  
  ```log
  âžœ  appium-workshop git:(master) âœ— npm run test.android
  
  > appium-workshop@1.0.0 test.android /Users/wswebcreation/Git/appium-workshop
  > wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.app.android.conf.js

  If this is the case, congrats ðŸŽ‰, if not, check the logs and see what is wrong / missing

### Exercises
In our previous step we already checked if the setup worked and we already ran our first test.
The master branch already holds the first exercise, which can be found [here](./docs/exercises/EXERCISE-1.md).

All other exercises can be found in branches called `exercise-#`, the `#` is the number of the exercise. Check the note at the beginning of this document!

The goal of each exercise and the steps you need to take can be found in the exercise documents.
